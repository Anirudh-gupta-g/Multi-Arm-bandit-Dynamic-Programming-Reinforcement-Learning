# Multi-Arm-bandit-Dynamic-Programming-Reinforcement-Learning

Goal of this is Project is 

Multi-Arm Bandit Problem: Imagine an innovative digital advertising agency, AdMasters Inc., that specializes in maximizing click-through rates (CTR) for their clients' advertisements. One of their clients has identified four key tunable elements in their ads: Age, City, Gender, and Mobile Operating System (OS). These elements significantly influence user engagement and conversion rates. The client is keen to optimize their CTR while minimizing resource expenditure.

Dynamic Programming : Develop a reinforcement learning agent using dynamic programming methods to solve the Dice game optimally. The agent will learn the optimal policy by iteratively evaluating and improving its strategy based on the state-value function and the Bellman equations.
